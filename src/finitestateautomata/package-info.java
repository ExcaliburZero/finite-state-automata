/**
 * The <code>finitestateautomata</code> package is a test of creating a class
 * that represents a finite state automata.
 * <br><br>
 * The package centers around the {@link EvenZerosMachine} class, which is a
 * representation of a machine which takes in Strings of 0's and 1's. It accepts
 * Strings that have an even number of 0's, including none. It rejects Strings
 * that have an odd number of 0's.
